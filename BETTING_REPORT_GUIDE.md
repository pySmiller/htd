# Betting Report Guide

This guide explains the contents of the betting summary files generated by the project. Use it to interpret the statistics and evaluate betting strategies.

## Files

- **`betting_analysis_report.txt`** – Sample summary created from quick predictions. It highlights high confidence opportunities, overall win rates and key strategy tips.
- **`betting_summary_report.txt`** – Produced by `generate_detailed_analysis.py`. It aggregates per-game results and shows win rates for spread and total bets.
- **`BETTING_PERFORMANCE_REPORT.txt`** – Created by `generate_betting_report.py` using the detailed analysis. This is the most complete report with monthly breakdowns and profit estimates.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Spread Win Rate** | Percentage of spread bets that beat the bookmaker line. |
| **Total Win Rate** | Percentage of total bets that beat the bookmaker line. |
| **ROI** | Expected return on investment assuming -110 odds. |
| **Confidence Level** | Strength of the model's prediction compared to the bookmaker. |

## Interpreting ROI

A positive ROI indicates the model would have produced profit with 1 unit per wager. Values are calculated using `0.91` profit for a winning bet (reflecting typical -110 vig). When ROI drops below zero the strategy is unprofitable.

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Generate predictions** using the main training or prediction script.
2. **Run `generate_detailed_analysis.py`** to create `detailed_betting_analysis.csv` and `betting_summary_report.txt`.
3. **Run `generate_betting_report.py`** to build `BETTING_PERFORMANCE_REPORT.txt` with formatted tables and strategy notes.
4. Review `BETTING_PERFORMANCE_REPORT.txt` for overall performance and monthly trends.

## Notes

- High confidence bets are highlighted because they historically show a better edge over the bookmaker.
- The reports assume standard American odds; adjust the ROI calculations if using different pricing.
- Always consider bankroll management and individual risk tolerance when acting on these summaries.
